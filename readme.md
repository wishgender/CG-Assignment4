# Assignment 4 Readme

## Additional libraries

* For sound, I used miniaudio, since it's a lightweight audio library that allows playing multiple sounds at once, which I needed in order to have background music and sound effects.
* For importing textures, I used stb_image to read the image files and use them as textures
* For importing models, I used assimp to import both fbx and obj meshes and render them.
